# THE 4 W’S and one H

## WHY? 

The system is able to calculate loans very easily and plus it is very handy.

## WHAT? 

There is a requirement of loan when anyone do not have enough money thus the system can be used before.

## WHEN? 

The system can be used anytime.

## WHERE? 

The system is beneficial for bank related purpose.

## HOW? 

The system requires certain documents like id proof, bank statement etc for verification before taking loan.

THE HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

• CIBIL score as the summary of credit history.

• Eligibility criterias.

THE LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS

• To set total loan period in months

• To set the initial amount.

• Calculate the initial loan amount, given: monthly payment, loan period and interest,loan balance after making several payments. 
  The loan interest given: (Interest Rate / number of Payments) *Loan principle.

• Customer need to set the yearly interest rate, the elapsed period in months, fees for opening the loan, set monthly loan payment.

# FEASIBILITY STUDY

## Technical Feasibility
• The project has a detailed design for the system and all the tools required to build the project are available for free.

• The system is being developed in C++ programming language.

### Visual Studio Code

• Visual Studio Code is an editor first, and includes the features you need for highly productive source code editing. 
  Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.
  
• It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, Typescript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other
languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity).

## Operational Feasibility

• In terms of hardware components, a machine is required which can meet the requirements and has sufficient storage space
to execute the code.

• For Software requirements, C++ support for Visual Studio Code is provided by a Microsoft C++ extension to enable cross-
platform C++ development on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Economic feasibility

• Cost efficient as it requires very less amount of money.

# SWOT ANALYSIS

## STRENGTHS

• Less time consuming
• Easy to use
• No need of calculations
• Less chances of error
• Versatile loans
• No need to maintain bulk of papers.
• Can be done remotely.

## WEAKNESS:

• High fees and penalties.
• High monthly payments.
• Interest rates are higher than home loans.
• Facing of higher debts on no payment of loans.

## OPPORTUNITIES:

• Increase in market demand as a lot of people loan as financial help.
• Rise in revenues.
• New technologies can be added in future with new updates.

## THREATS:

• Hardware/software failures.
• Leakage of personal information as important documents require personal data that must be handled with care.
• False document possibility as may be some people submit come up with false identity.
• Storage issue as it requires a lot of memory to store all data in a big amount.
